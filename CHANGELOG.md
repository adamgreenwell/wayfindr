# Changelog

All notable changes to Wayfindr are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
as scoped by ADR [0012](docs/decisions/0012-platform-versioning.md) — where a
**major** release means *the operator must do something beyond pulling the image
and restarting*, not merely that an API changed.

## Does this release need me?

Wayfindr is self-hosted, so the question every entry here has to answer is
whether an upgrade is safe to take unattended. Each release therefore opens with
one of:

- **Requires operator action** — followed by exactly what to do. Pulling and
  restarting is *not* enough; something (a process, a config key, a manual
  migration) must be done by hand.
- **No operator action required** — pull, restart, and migrations run themselves.

If you are several releases behind, read **every** release between yours and your
target, not just the newest: an action required by a release you skipped still
applies to you.

Entries are grouped with the Keep a Changelog headings — `Added`, `Changed`,
`Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security` — and anything that requires
operator action is also marked inline with **⚠ Operator action** so it cannot be
missed while skimming.

## [Unreleased]

**⚠ Requires operator action.** Running backups from the operator GUI needs a
**second queue worker** on the dedicated `backups` connection. Without it the
"Run a backup now" button queues jobs nothing will ever process, and the run sits
at *Running* indefinitely. Scheduled backups are unaffected.

```bash
# Compose stacks get the backup-queue service from the refreshed compose.yml.
# On Forge or any host-managed setup, add a second worker:
php artisan queue:work backups --queue=backups --sleep=5 --tries=1 --timeout=3600
```

### Added

- Operator settings under `/operator`: mail, attachment storage, malware
  scanning, and backups are configured in the browser, stored in the database,
  and override env without a restart (ADR 0011).
- A guided onboarding checklist as the landing page after `/setup`, replacing the
  read-only readiness screen for first-run configuration.
- Backup and restore: `wayfindr:backup` and a guarded `wayfindr:restore`, with an
  optional offsite mirror to an S3-compatible bucket and age-based retention
  (ADR 0009, ADR 0010).
- **⚠ Operator action** — Operator backups GUI: configure destination, retention,
  and per-install prefix; run a backup on demand; review run history; and perform
  a confirmed in-GUI restore. Running backups from the GUI needs the second queue
  worker described above; without it those runs never start. The in-GUI restore
  additionally requires a Redis-backed queue, cache, and maintenance state — where
  that is not met, the page explains why and points to the CLI (ADR 0011).

### Fixed

- A restore no longer treats two unverifiable versions as a match. Installs
  without a release identity reported `unknown` on both sides, which compared
  equal and silently skipped the schema-mismatch guard; an unverifiable pair now
  keeps the site in maintenance for the operator to check.

Releases before this changelog — `v0.1.0-alpha.1` through `v0.1.0-alpha.3`
(2026-07-21 to 2026-07-22) — are not reconstructed here. They are early alpha
builds, and their history lives in the git tags and commit log. This changelog
starts fresh rather than backfilling entries after the fact; the gap is
deliberate, not an absence of changes. Everything merged *after* `alpha.3` is
recorded under **Unreleased** above, so an operator upgrading from it still gets
the full picture.
